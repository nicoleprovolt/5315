      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a version control system for code developers. Git allows for multiple developers to work in tandem with each other on the same source code. The code is tracked and stored on GIT and is updated on each developer’s computer as well as the central server. This is important so that there is no overlap in code. Any updates that are made are all tracked and stored, so at any time the previous versions of the code can be accessed. Keeping all developers on the same version of code reduces errors and increases efficiency.

      <p> Local Repo – A repository is a data structure that is used to store files and versions of files for GIT. The local repo would be the repository that is local to each developer’s computer. 
Remote Repo- The remote repo is the common repository that all team members push their new versions of code to and pull other developers code changes from. While each developer will have their own local repo, there will only be one remote repo for a team project. https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61

How to use Git in a team project? – Git allows all developers in  a team to be able to pull the same source code from the remote repo. Each developer can make the necessary changes to the source code and push this code from their local repo back to the remote repo. Git can then merge all the changes to the original source code together.
