      <p> A virtual machine is basically a computer inside of another computer.It is an enitre computer system that runs inside of a program window, just like you would run any other applications on your computer. When the user is on the VM, the user interface looks like the same interface as a local computer. The VM creates a barrier inside of itself, so that none of the software or files on the VM can escape and infest the local machine.
